# Dungeon-Game

Created February 2nd, 2020

Creates a game where the user is put into a "dungeon". User starts off by choosing a class, then which has varying attributes like total HP and gold collection multiplier. The player navigates through the map jumping room from room and encounters either gold, HP potions, or monsters. The player can either fight the monsters or run away. The game ends when the player gets 100 gold (the player wins) or the player runs out of HP (the player loses).
